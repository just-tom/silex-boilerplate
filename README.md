#[Just Tom](http://www.justtom.me) - Silex Boilerplate
---

Current Version: `1.0.0`

###Description
---
This is a very simple Silex boilerplate I built for personal use to get small web apps up and running fast. It  uses Silex 1.2.2

It has [Capistrano](http://capistranorb.com/) integrated for easy deployments and a vagrant file which is provisioned for a lamp stack for testing on.

The frontend uses a [bootstrap gulp package](https://github.com/carlosl/gulpstrap)


###Installation
---

 * Clone the repo to your local machine
 * `cd` into the root of the directory
 * Run `git remote rm origin` to remove my remote
 * Run `git remote -v` to double check there are no remotes
 * If you want to, remove the `.git` directory
 * Run `git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repo-name.git` to add a new point of origin to your repository. (Please replace `username` & `repo-name` with your own credentials)
 * Add and commit all the files to the `master` branch
 * Run `git push -u origin master` to create the upstream
